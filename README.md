# TestingTesseract
Test code for OCR using PyTesseract with different preprocessing steps

- largely based on the tutorial https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/07/10/using-tesseract-ocr-python/
- skew correction based on https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/02/20/text-skew-correction-opencv-python/

## Future steps
- perspective and other distortion correction
- local contrast correction
- transforming output text to suitable table format
